# *How to do set profile pictures?*

###  For QB:
```
Only use trigger for server
TriggerEvent('wais:setCidPicture', source, cid, url)

source: Number, Player source
cid: Number, Player chracter id
url: String, Image url
```

### For ESX:
```
Only use trigger for server
TriggerEvent('wais:setCidPicture', source, charid, url)
source: Number, Player source
charid: Number, Player character id like char"1":xxxx we need char number
url: String, Image url
```

# WARNING FOR QB!
There is one step that our customers using qb-core need to do. This is an important situation.

- Open the `qb-core > server > player.lua` file.
- Find the `QBCore.Player.CheckPlayerData` function.
- Go to the last line of this function. In the last line of this function you will see the following function. `QBCore.Player.CreatePlayer(PlayerData)`
- If this function is redirected with return, go above it, if there is no return, go below it and paste the following code here. `TriggerEvent('wais:sendNewCharacterData', source, PlayerData.cid, PlayerData.citizenid)`
